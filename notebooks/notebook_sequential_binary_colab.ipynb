    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will perform sequential binary classification analysis using LLMs. Binary classification refers to the task of categorizing data entries into one of two predefined categories. Here, we explore a specific case where binary classifications are conducted sequentially, with the final classification outcome depending on the results of prior classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you navigate this notebook, here is a step-by-step outline of what we will do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Getting started**  \n",
    "   - Download and install the project and its dependencies, load import and your API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load and preprocess the dataset**  \n",
    "   - Upload, explore and pre-process the dataset, with the sample dataset (recommended for a first use) or your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prompt construction and classification on manually annotated data**  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluating Model Performance Against Human Annotations**  \n",
    "   - Compute metrics (e.g., **Cohen's Kappa**, **Alt-Test**, ...)\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset provided for this notebook is an anonymized subset from the study available at [X]. In the original experiment, children were tasked with reading a reference text and engaging in four sequential interactions with an interactive app. The goal of these steps was to help the children formulate a divergent question. A question is considered divergent if its answer is not explicitly stated in the reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four steps, include:\n",
    "1. **Identify**: The child identifies a knowledge gap related to the reference text.\n",
    "2. **Guess**: The child makes a guess about what the answer to the knowledge gap could be.\n",
    "3. **Seek**: The child formulates a question to seek the answer.\n",
    "4. **Assess**: The child evaluates whether the app provides an answer to their question.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called a **cycle**. An annotator evaluates the validity of a cycle by answering a series of binary Yes/No questions (binary classifications). A cycle is deemed valid if all binary questions can be answered by \"Yes\"; otherwise, it is considered invalid. For more details, see the codebook provided in the prompt cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the following key components:\n",
    "- **ref**: A column containing the text that children were asked to read beforehand.\n",
    "- **IDENTIFY**: A column containing the entries posed by the children during the Identify step.\n",
    "- **GUESS**: A column containing the entries posed by the children during the Guess step.\n",
    "- **SEEK**: A column containing the entries posed by the children during the Seek step.\n",
    "- **ASSESS**: A column containing the entries posed by the children during the Assess step.\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify a cycle, both the reference text and the entries from all four steps are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the dataset includes ratings from two human annotators. These ratings enable us to compute inter-annotator agreement metrics, such as Cohen's kappa, to assess the reliability of the annotations once the analysis is complete."

    "### LLM Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "- `provider_llm1`: The LLM provider used for classification (`azure`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`)\n",
    "- `model_name_llm1`: The model used for classification. This depends on the provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For** `azure` ‚Üí `\"gpt-4o\"` or `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`\n",

    "- **For** `gemini` ‚Üí `\"gemini-2.0-flash-001\"`, `\"gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `temperature_llm1`: Controls output variability. Set to `0` for deterministic responses. Higher values add randomness (not recommended for evaluation tasks).\n",
    "- `subsample_size`: Number of entries to evaluate. Set to `-1` to use the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "- `prompt_name`: A short name identifying the scenario, used in performance tracking.\n",
    "- `template`: The full prompt used to guide the LLM. It could include:\n",

    "- `selected_fields`: The fields to extract from the LLM‚Äôs output (e.g., `\"Classification\"`, `\"Reasoning\"`).  \n",
    "  You can modify this to include or exclude elements (like adding confidence scores, removing reasonning).\n",
    "- `prefix`: The key to look for in the LLM output that contains the classification label (e.g., `\"Classification\"`).\n",
    "Nous sp√©cifions donc cela pour que le parsing du verdict soit plus facile, pour r√©cuperer les labels de classification.\n",

    "  but can be changed to `\"float\"` or `\"str\"` as needed.\n",
    "- `response_template`: The required format of the LLM output (e.g., JSON). This ensures correct parsing. It is recommended not to change this format request.\n",
    "- `json_output`: If `True`, the LLM must respond in JSON. Disabling this is not recommended. If you do, you will have to  \n",

    "- `max_iterations`: How many times the prompt should be revised.\n",
    "For example, if you choose 3, each data entry will be classified three times: once with the original prompt, and twice with newly generated prompts.\n",
    "- `use_validation_set`: Whether to use a separate validation set to monitor prompt overfitting (Boolean)\n",

    "Before launching the classification on the entire dataset, we first run it on the subset that has been manually annotated.  \n",
    "This step allows us to compute performance metrics (e.g., **accuracy**, **F1-score**) by comparing LLM predictions to human labels,  \n",
    "and therefore select which (if any) scenario can be used to classify the full, unlabeled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration Parameters\n",

    "- `annotation_columns`: The names of the columns containing human annotations.\n",
    "- `labels`: The possible label values (in this case, `[0, 1]` for binary classification).\n",

    "We filter out any rows with missing values in the annotation columns to ensure we're only evaluating on fully labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Repeated Runs for Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are **stochastic** by nature ‚Äî even with a temperature of `0`, outputs can vary.  \n",
    "To assess how consistent the model is, we introduce the `n_runs` parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n_runs`: The number of times the classification is repeated for each scenario on the annotated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend setting `n_runs = 3`, based on findings from **[Paper XX]** (insert reference),  \n",
    "which showed that **three repetitions strike a good balance between stability and cost**.  \n",
    "Running more times improves statistical reliability but increases costs proportionally.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs important to distinguish between these two concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`n_completions`**:  \n",
    "  Controls how many responses are generated **within a single run** for each data point.  \n",
    "  The final label is determined by **majority vote** over those completions.  \n",
    "  **Example**:  \n",
    "  If `n_completions = 3` and the model returns `[0, 0, 1]`, the selected label will be `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`n_runs`**:  \n",
    "  Repeats the **entire classification process** multiple times across the same data.  \n",
    "  If you run the scenario three times and get `[0, 0, 1]` for a given entry,  \n",
    "  that variation will be captured when calculating metrics (e.g., **variance**, **disagreement rate**)."

The Assess step provides an answer about the temperature range in tropical rainforests, but it does not directly resolve the Seek step, which was not a question. The Identify, Guess, and Seek steps are related to the topic of the reference text, but the Seek question originality criterion is not met because the Seek step is not a question. Therefore, the cycle is invalid.\",\n",

The Assess step provides a partial answer, mentioning that only a small portion of organisms can leave traces.

The Assess step 'C'est bon' does not provide a clear answer to the Seek question nor does it state that no answer was found. The Identify, Guess, and Seek steps are not consistently related to the same question, as the Seek step diverges to a different topic (archeology).

The Assess step provides an answer about the temperature range in tropical rainforests, but it does not directly resolve the Seek step, which was not a question. The Identify, Guess, and Seek steps are related to the topic of the reference text, but the Seek question originality criterion is not met because the Seek step is not a question. Therefore, the cycle is invalid.\",\n",

Seek Step: The Seek step is formulated as a question, 'Dans quelle ville il restedes trace', which is valid. 4. Assess Step: The Assess step states 'je n ai pas la reponse a ma question', indicating no answer was found, which is acceptable. 5. Consistency: The Identify, Guess, and Seek steps are not consistently related to the same question or topic. 6. Reference Link: The steps are not related to the topic of the reference text, which is about fossils, not cities or statues. 7. Seek Question Originality: The Seek question does not have an answer in the reference text, which is valid. 8. Resolving Answer: The Assess step correctly states no answer was found, aligning with the Seek step. 9. Valid No: The claim of no answer found is valid as the Seek question is not answered in the reference text. Overall, the cycle fails to meet several criteria, particularly in terms of topic relevance and consistency, making it invalid.\",\n",

The Assess step states 'Ma reponse n'est pas marque,' which does not clearly identify a possible answer or state that no answer was found. Additionally, the steps are not consistently related to the same question, and the Seek question does not appear to be original or distinct from the reference text. Overall, the cycle lacks clarity and coherence, making it invalid.\",\n",

    "\n",
    "To determine whether the model's classification is reliable and can be used to annotate the rest of the unlabeled dataset,  \n",
    "it is recommended to evaluate its alignment with human annotations.  \n",
    "If the alignment is sufficiently high, you may choose to rely on the model-generated labels for the remaining data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose **four types of analysis**, depending on your goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If you want to measure agreement between annotators**:  \n",
    "  Use **Cohen's Kappa**, a simple and widely used metric for inter-rater agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If you need detailed per-class performance metrics** (e.g., recall, true positives, false positives):  \n",
    "  Use **Classification Metrics**. This method gives a descriptive breakdown of model performance by class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If you have multiple manual annotations and want a more robust estimate**:  \n",
    "  Use **Krippendorff's Alpha**. This method provides:\n",
    "  - A confidence interval for the agreement, computed via bootstrapping\n",
    "  - An estimate of the risk that the true alpha value lies outside this interval\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If you have multiple annotation columns (‚â• 3)** and want to assess whether the model can \"replace\" or **outperform individual annotators**,  \n",
    "  and you can afford to annotate 50‚Äì100 entries:  \n",
    "  Use the **Alt-Test**. This stricter test compares the model to each annotator using a **leave-one-out** approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the available methods, **Krippendorff‚Äôs Alpha** and the **Alt-Test** are the ones we consider more **rigorous and robust**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note 1**: The final decision on whether the model's performance is ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù depends on your research domain,  \n",
    "> acceptable error tolerance, and practical factors such as annotation cost and time. It can be totally valid to accept the model based solely on its Cohen‚Äôs kappa score,\n",
    " if it is approximately equivalent to human inter-rater agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note 2**: If the agreement between human annotators is low, the issue likely lies in the codebook (e.g., unclear guidelines) or the annotation task itself.\n",
    "> In such cases, it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect the LLM to achieve high performance if humans themselves struggle to agree on the correct labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note 3**: If you're not satisfied with the model‚Äôs performance, you can go back and **adjust the scenario** (this may include updating the codebook, adding examples, using another model...)  \n",
    "> ‚ö†Ô∏è However, if you do this **multiple times**, it is strongly recommended to use a **validation set** to avoid overfitting to your annotated subset."
